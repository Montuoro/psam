## ATAR Performance Overview

### School ATAR Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average ATAR** | 77.67 |
| **Highest ATAR** | 99.95 |
| **Lowest ATAR** | 0.00 |
| **Total Students** | 205 |
| **Course Mean** | 29.98 |

### ATAR Impact Analysis

**Above Average:** School ATAR 77.7 is above state median. 
Focus on elevating underperforming courses to push more students into 85+ ATAR range (top quartile).

**Key Finding:** Course performance (mean 30.0) directly impacts ATAR outcomes. 
Each 1-point improvement in course means translates approximately 0.3-0.5 points in ATAR scaling, 
making targeted course interventions critical for ATAR improvement.

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines **42 courses** across Abbotsleigh, categorizing by performance tier:

- **17 Courses of Concern** - Declining trend or >3 points below average
- **11 Middling Courses** - Stable performance near school mean  
- **14 High Performers** - Improving trend or >3 points above average

**Critical Context:** Courses of concern don't just represent poor performance—they directly limit 
student ATAR outcomes and university entrance prospects. Each significantly underperforming course 
can reduce a student's ATAR by 2-4 points, potentially costing competitive university placements.

### PDHPE

**Portfolio:** 1 courses | 33 students | Avg deviation: -7.38

#### Courses Requiring Intervention (1)

##### PDHPE

**Performance Summary:**
- Mean: **22.6** (-7.38 vs school avg 30.0)
- Cohort: 33 students
- Trend: ➡️ stable
- Change: -0.10 points from 2023
- ATAR Impact: Students in this course average 83.1 ATAR

**Analysis & Insights:**
**Low Excellence Rate:** Only 0% achieving Band 6/E4 (vs. typical 15-20% for performing courses). Combined with below-average mean, this indicates systemic issues. Priority: Identify and support high-potential students who could reach Band 6 with intervention.

**Negative Scaling Impact:** Course scaled score (40.0) is 51.1 points below raw HSC mark (91.1). This course scales down, meaning student effort yields lower ATAR contribution. While this is partially cohort-driven statewide, consistent underperformance compounds the effect.

**Heatmap Analysis - Specific Directions:**
Open heatmap: `abbotsleigh_heat_1.png`

**Scaled Exam Mark Column:** Your course shows 7.4 points below average. In the heatmap, check if 'Scaled Exam Mark' z-score is dark gray/brown (negative). This confirms exam performance is the primary drag factor vs. assessment marks.

**Total Z-Score Column (rightmost):** Your 7.4 point deficit likely translates to z-score around -0.7 to -0.9 (dark tan/gray in heatmap). This indicates consistent underperformance across ALL metrics, not just one weak area. This pattern demands comprehensive program review, not targeted fixes.

**Departmental Comparison:** In heatmap, compare this course's row to other PDHPE courses. If all PDHPE courses show negative z-scores, this is a department-wide issue requiring leadership intervention.

**Database Deep-Dive:**
- Query student-level data for PDHPE to identify:
  - Students with large assessment-vs-exam gaps (indicates exam anxiety or preparation issues)
  - Cohort composition: Are underperformers concentrated in specific assessment tasks?
  - Correlation with other courses: Do students struggling here also struggle in related subjects?

### Sciences

**Portfolio:** 5 courses | 179 students | Avg deviation: -1.24

#### Courses Requiring Intervention (2)

##### Biology

**Performance Summary:**
- Mean: **26.0** (-3.98 vs school avg 30.0)
- Cohort: 70 students
- Trend: ➡️ stable
- Change: +0.00 points from 2023
- ATAR Impact: Students in this course average 88.9 ATAR

**Analysis & Insights:**
**Exam Underperformance:** Students score 5.1 points lower on exams than internal assessments. This indicates a gap between classroom learning and exam execution. Increase exam-style practice and time-constrained assessment tasks.

**Low Excellence Rate:** Only 0% achieving Band 6/E4 (vs. typical 15-20% for performing courses). Combined with below-average mean, this indicates systemic issues. Priority: Identify and support high-potential students who could reach Band 6 with intervention.

**Negative Scaling Impact:** Course scaled score (43.1) is 48.8 points below raw HSC mark (91.9). This course scales down, meaning student effort yields lower ATAR contribution. While this is partially cohort-driven statewide, consistent underperformance compounds the effect.

##### Earth & Environmental Science

**Performance Summary:**
- Mean: **22.6** (-7.38 vs school avg 30.0)
- Cohort: 3 students
- Trend: ➡️ stable
- Change: +0.10 points from 2023
- ATAR Impact: Students in this course average 95.2 ATAR

**Analysis & Insights:**
**Exam Underperformance:** Students score 11.5 points lower on exams than internal assessments. This indicates a gap between classroom learning and exam execution. Increase exam-style practice and time-constrained assessment tasks.

**Low Excellence Rate:** Only 0% achieving Band 6/E4 (vs. typical 15-20% for performing courses). Combined with below-average mean, this indicates systemic issues. Priority: Identify and support high-potential students who could reach Band 6 with intervention.

## Strategic Priorities

### Why These Recommendations Matter

Each recommendation is driven by data patterns indicating specific, fixable problems:

- **Assessment-exam gaps** suggest misalignment between classroom teaching and HSC exam demands
- **Low Band 6 rates** indicate failure to stretch high-achievers who could drive school performance
- **ATAR impacts** quantify real consequences: underperformance here = lost university places
- **Heatmap z-scores** provide visual proof for stakeholders and focus intervention efforts

---

## Conclusions & Next Steps

**Systemic Issues Detected:** 40% of courses underperforming suggests school-wide problems, 
not isolated course failures. Root causes likely include inadequate professional development, curriculum 
misalignment with HSC standards, or assessment practice inconsistencies.

### Timeline

| Phase | Action | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **This week** | Share report with department heads | Establish shared understanding of problems |
| **Week 2** | Deep-dive analysis using heatmaps & database queries | Identify root causes |
| **Week 3-4** | Implement first interventions | Quick wins to build momentum |
| **Quarter 2** | Re-run analysis | Measure intervention effectiveness |

**Remember:** Every 1-point course improvement ≈ 0.3-0.5 ATAR points for students. Small course gains create 
significant university entrance opportunities.
