## Departmental Analysis & Recommendations

### Creative Arts

**Portfolio:** 7 courses | 97 students | Avg deviation: -3.27

#### Courses Requiring Intervention (5)

##### Software Design & Develop

**Performance Summary:**
- Mean: **26.6** (-3.38 vs school avg 30.0)
- Cohort: 7 students
- Trend: stable
- Change: +0.20 points from 2023
- **Multi-Year:** 2020=25.6, 2021=25.6, 2022=26.8, 2023=26.4, 2024=26.6

**Analysis & Insights:**
**True ATAR Impact (FIXED SCALING):** Raw HSC mark 92.0 scales to 81.4 unit contribution (penalty: 10.6 points). For every 10-point HSC improvement, students gain ~8.8 ATAR units. Reasonable scaling preserves student effort value.

**Cross-Course Struggle Pattern:** Students taking Software Design & Develop also show below-average performance in Mathematics Ext 1, Physics, Mathematics Ext 2. This suggests a shared challenge—possibly academic rigor expectations, exam technique, or student cohort composition. Coordinate intervention across these departments.

**Shared Assessment-Exam Disconnect:** Students taking Software Design & Develop also show assessment-exam gaps in Mathematics Advanced (-9.4 points). This is likely a student cohort issue (exam anxiety, time management) rather than subject-specific. Consider cross-departmental exam skills workshops.

**High-ATAR Cohort Selection:** Students taking Software Design & Develop average 89.7 ATAR (+12.0 vs school). This course attracts high performers. Underperformance here is particularly concerning as it affects students who should be achieving top results.

**Heatmap Analysis - Specific Directions:**
Open heatmap: `abbotsleigh_heat_1.png`

**Heatmap Analysis for Software Design & Develop:**

Open: `abbotsleigh_heat_1.png` and locate the row for 'Software Design & Develop'.

→ **Column 4 (State Z-Score):** Compare to state-wide performance. If negative (gray), your school underperforms state average for this subject. If positive (blue), school outperforms state despite below-school-average performance.

→ **Column 6 (Course Contribution to Aggregate):** Higher values (blue) mean this course contributes more to student ATARs. Low/negative values (gray) indicate course is being dropped or scaling poorly, not contributing to final ATAR calculations.

→ **Columns 10-11 (2-Year Comparison Lower/Upper 50%):** Check if lower-performing students (column 10) show different trends than high-performers (column 11). If both gray, entire cohort declining. If column 10 is gray but 11 is neutral, your weaker students are falling behind.

**Database Deep-Dive - Actual Findings:**

##### Geography

**Performance Summary:**
- Mean: **25.4** (-4.58 vs school avg 30.0)
- Cohort: 55 students
- Trend: stable
- Change: -0.40 points from 2023
- **Multi-Year:** 2020=25.4, 2021=25.3, 2022=25.4, 2023=25.8, 2024=25.4

**Analysis & Insights:**
**True ATAR Impact (FIXED SCALING):** Raw HSC mark 92.0 scales to 84.2 unit contribution (penalty: 7.8 points). For every 10-point HSC improvement, students gain ~9.2 ATAR units. Reasonable scaling preserves student effort value.

**Cross-Course Struggle Pattern:** Students taking Geography also show below-average performance in Biology, Mathematics Ext 1. This suggests a shared challenge—possibly academic rigor expectations, exam technique, or student cohort composition. Coordinate intervention across these departments.

**Shared Assessment-Exam Disconnect:** Students taking Geography also show assessment-exam gaps in English Advanced (-12.8 points). This is likely a student cohort issue (exam anxiety, time management) rather than subject-specific. Consider cross-departmental exam skills workshops.

**High-ATAR Cohort Selection:** Students taking Geography average 91.3 ATAR (+13.6 vs school). This course attracts high performers. Underperformance here is particularly concerning as it affects students who should be achieving top results.

Open: `abbotsleigh_heat_1.png` and locate the row for 'English Standard'.

→ **Column 2 (Scaled Score to Mean):** Expect dark gray/brown (z-score < -0.5). This shows course performance relative to school average. Your -9.9 point deficit should appear as strongly negative z-score.

→ **Column 4 (State Z-Score):** Compare to state-wide performance. If negative (gray), your school underperforms state average for this subject. If positive (blue), school outperforms state despite below-school-average performance.

→ **Column 6 (Course Contribution to Aggregate):** Higher values (blue) mean this course contributes more to student ATARs. Low/negative values (gray) indicate course is being dropped or scaling poorly, not contributing to final ATAR calculations.

→ **Columns 10-11 (2-Year Comparison Lower/Upper 50%):** Check if lower-performing students (column 10) show different trends than high-performers (column 11). If both gray, entire cohort declining. If column 10 is gray but 11 is neutral, your weaker students are falling behind.

#### High Performers (2)

##### English Extension 1 ⭐

**Performance:** Mean 36.2 (+6.22 vs avg) | Cohort: 30
**Historical:** 2020=36.4, 2021=36.6, 2022=36.2, 2023=36.3, 2024=36.2

**Scaling Advantage:** Course contributes 83.2 units to ATAR (from raw HSC 46.8), only 36.4 point scaling penalty. Strong statewide performance means students' efforts translate efficiently to ATAR outcomes. This partially explains why high-achieving students select this course.

**Consistent Excellence:** Performance stable over 5 years (mean std dev: 0.07). This isn't a one-off result but sustained quality. Investigate: teacher retention, curriculum stability, departmental leadership practices.

**Student Profile:** 30 students also take English Advanced (avg mark: 91.1). High performers in this course tend to be strong across multiple subjects, suggesting effective student support structures.

##### English Extension 2 ⭐

**Performance:** Mean 35.8 (+5.82 vs avg) | Cohort: 8
**Historical:** 2020=36.5, 2021=36.6, 2022=35.9, 2023=36.3, 2024=35.8

**Strong Assessment Alignment:** Internal assessments (46.0) closely match exam performance (48.0), difference only 2.0 points. This indicates assessments accurately prepare students for HSC exams. Share assessment task designs with departments showing large gaps.

**Scaling Advantage:** Course contributes 89.8 units to ATAR (from raw HSC 48.6), only 41.2 point scaling penalty. Strong statewide performance means students' efforts translate efficiently to ATAR outcomes. This partially explains why high-achieving students select this course.

**Consistent Excellence:** Performance stable over 5 years (mean std dev: 0.14). This isn't a one-off result but sustained quality. Investigate: teacher retention, curriculum stability, departmental leadership practices.

**Student Profile:** 8 students also take English Extension 1 (avg mark: 45.1). High performers in this course tend to be strong across multiple subjects, suggesting effective student support structures.

Performing near school average. Monitor quarterly.


## Conclusions & Strategic Priorities

**Systemic Findings:** 17/42 courses underperforming suggests school-wide challenges requiring coordinated response.

**Key Actions:**
1. Address cross-course struggle patterns identified in deep-dives
2. Replicate high-performer teaching strategies in underperforming courses
3. Fix scaling-disadvantaged courses to improve ATAR outcomes
4. Monitor multi-year trends quarterly to catch deterioration early

**Remember:** Every 1-point course improvement ≈ 0.3-0.5 ATAR points for students.
